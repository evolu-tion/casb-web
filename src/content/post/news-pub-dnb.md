🔬 The research team goes beyond transitional DEG analysis by applying another network biology concepts to find key genes responsible for the transition stage in complex organsim (Go to the paper for looking for it)

👉🏻 Our team discovered a key player called "Trehalase", a key enzymatic gene in trehalose metabolism that plays a crucial role in the transition of fibrous to storage roots.

👉🏻 This gene plays a role in connecting transcriptional regulation and metabolic process leading to storage root formation.

🌱 We hope that this research will contribute to the advancement of knowledge in this field and inspire further research in the future.
